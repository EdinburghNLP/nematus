&@@ lt@@ ; title &gt; Life in the deep oceans &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ title &gt;
&@@ lt@@ ; description &gt; With vibrant video clips captured by sub@@ marines , David Gallo takes us to some of Earth &apos;s dark@@ est , most violent , toxic and beautiful habitats , the valleys and volcanic ridges of the oceans &apos; depths , where life is bizarre , resilient and sho@@ ck@@ ingly abundant . &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ description &gt;
this is Bill Lange . I &apos;m Dave Gallo .
and we &apos;re going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video .
we &apos;ve got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that &apos;s ever been seen , and we &apos;re not going to show you any of it .
the truth of the matter is that the Titanic -- even though it &apos;s breaking all sorts of box office records -- it &apos;s not the most exciting story from the sea .
and the problem , I think , is that we take the ocean for granted .
when you think about it , the oceans are 75 percent of the planet .
most of the planet is ocean water .
the average depth is about two miles .
part of the problem , I think , is we stand at the beach , or we see images like this of the ocean , and you look out at this great big blue expan@@ se , and it &apos;s sh@@ immer@@ ing and it &apos;s moving and there &apos;s waves and there &apos;s surf and there &apos;s tides , but you have no idea for what lies in there .
and in the oceans , there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet .
most of the animals are in the oceans .
most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea , at the bottom of the sea .
the biodiversity and the bio@@ density in the ocean is higher , in places , than it is in the rain@@ forests .
it &apos;s mostly un@@ explored , and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captiv@@ ate us and make us become familiar with it .
but when you &apos;re standing at the beach , I want you to think that you &apos;re standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world .
we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world .
we use the submarine Al@@ vin and we use cameras , and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony .
Marcel Pro@@ ust said , `` The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes . &apos;&apos;
people that have partn@@ ered with us have given us new eyes , not only on what exists -- the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea -- but also how we think about life on the planet itself .
here &apos;s a j@@ elly .
it &apos;s one of my favorites , because it &apos;s got all sorts of working parts .
this turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans .
it gets up to about 150 feet long .
but see all those different working things ?
I love that kind of stuff .
it &apos;s got these fishing l@@ ures on the bottom . they &apos;re going up and down .
it &apos;s got tent@@ acles dan@@ gling , s@@ wir@@ ling around like that .
it &apos;s a colonial animal .
these are all individual animals b@@ anding together to make this one creature .
and it &apos;s got these jet th@@ ru@@ sters up in front that it &apos;ll use in a moment , and a little light .
if you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that , put them on one side of the scale , put all the j@@ ell@@ y-@@ type of animals on the other side , those guys win hands down .
most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this .
here &apos;s the X-@@ Wing death j@@ elly .
the bi@@ ol@@ umin@@ escence -- they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating .
we could n&apos;t begin to show you our archival stuff from the jel@@ lies .
they come in all different sizes and shapes .
we tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average , and that we &apos;re real familiar with the animals that are in the first 200 or 300 feet , but we &apos;re not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom .
and these are the types of animals that live in that three-dimensional space , that micro-@@ gravity environment that we really have n&apos;t explored .
you hear about giant s@@ quid and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 , 160 feet long .
they &apos;re very little understood .
this is one of them , another one of our favorites , because it &apos;s a little oc@@ to@@ pod .
you can actually see through his head .
and here he is , fl@@ apping with his ears and very grac@@ efully going up .
we see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths .
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .
they come right up to the submarine -- they &apos;ll put their eyes right up to the window and pe@@ ek inside the sub .
this is really a world within a world , and we &apos;re going to show you two .
in this case , we &apos;re passing down through the mid-@@ ocean and we see creatures like this .
this is kind of like an under@@ sea ro@@ o@@ ster .
this guy , that looks incredibly formal , in a way .
and then one of my favorites . what a face !
this is basically scientific data that you &apos;re looking at .
it &apos;s footage that we &apos;ve collected for scientific purposes .
and that &apos;s one of the things that Bill &apos;s been doing , is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this , in the world where they belong .
they do n&apos;t catch them in a net .
they &apos;re actually looking at them down in that world .
we &apos;re going to take a jo@@ ystick , sit in front of our computer , on the Earth , and press the jo@@ ystick forward , and fly around the planet .
we &apos;re going to look at the mid-@@ ocean ridge , a 4@@ 0,@@ 000-@@ mile long mountain range .
the average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half .
and we &apos;re over the Atlantic -- that &apos;s the ridge right there -- but we &apos;re going to go across the Caribbean , Central America , and end up against the Pacific , nine degrees north .
we make maps of these mountain ranges with sound , with son@@ ar , and this is one of those mountain ranges .
we &apos;re coming around a cliff here on the right .
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases .
and there &apos;s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that have n&apos;t been mapped yet .
this is a volcanic ridge .
we &apos;re getting down further and further in scale .
and eventually , we can come up with something like this .
this is an icon of our robot , Jason , it &apos;s called .
and you can sit in a room like this , with a jo@@ ystick and a headset , and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time .
one of the things we &apos;re trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world -- this world , this un@@ explored region -- back to the laboratory .
because we see it in bits and pieces right now .
we see it either as sound , or we see it as video , or we see it as photographs , or we see it as chemical sensors , but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture .
here &apos;s where Bill &apos;s cameras really do shine .
this is what &apos;s called a hydro@@ thermal vent .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is a cloud of densely packed , hydro@@ gen-@@ sul@@ fi@@ de-@@ rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor .
gets up to 600 , 700 degrees F , somewhere in that range .
so that &apos;s all water under the sea -- a mile and a half , two miles , three miles down .
and we knew it was volcanic back in the ` 60s , ` 70s .
and then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it , because if you &apos;ve got volcan@@ ism , water &apos;s going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor , come in contact with mag@@ ma , and come shooting out hot .
we were n&apos;t really aware that it would be so rich with sul@@ fi@@ des , hydrogen sul@@ fi@@ des .
we did n&apos;t have any idea about these things , which we call chim@@ neys .
this is one of these hydro@@ thermal vents .
six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth .
on either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps , so the setting here is very dramatic .
the white material is a type of bacteria that thri@@ ves at 180 degrees C .
I think that &apos;s one of the greatest stories right now that we &apos;re seeing from the bottom of the sea , is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria .
and we started to wonder for a long time , how did it all get down there ?
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the Earth .
not only is it coming out of the Earth -- so , bio@@ genesis made from volcanic activity -- but that bacteria supports these colonies of life .
the pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch .
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .
all the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth -- so , chem@@ osyn@@ thesis .
and you can see how dense the population is .
these are called tube worms .
these worms have no digestive system . they have no mouth .
but they have two types of gil@@ l structures .
one for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water , another one which houses this chem@@ osyn@@ thetic bacteria , which takes the hydro@@ thermal fluid -- that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom -- and converts that into simple sugar@@ s that the tube worm can digest .
you can see , here &apos;s a cr@@ ab that lives down there .
he &apos;s managed to grab a tip of these worms .
now , they normally re@@ tract as soon as a cr@@ ab touches them .
Oh ! good going .
so , as soon as a cr@@ ab touches them , they re@@ tract down into their shells , just like your finger@@ nails .
there &apos;s a whole story being played out here that we &apos;re just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology .
these worms live in a real temperature extreme .
their foot is at about 200 degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C , so it &apos;s like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water .
that &apos;s how they like to live .
this is a female of this kind of worm .
and here &apos;s a male .
you watch . it does n&apos;t take long before two guys here -- this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight .
everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
here they go .
on one of the last dive series , we counted 200 species in these areas -- 198 were new , new species .
one of the big problems is that for the bi@@ ologists working at these sites , it &apos;s rather difficult to collect these animals .
and they disintegr@@ ate on the way up , so the imagery is critical for the science .
two oc@@ topo@@ ds at about two miles depth .
this pressure thing really amaz@@ es me -- that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pep@@ si can .
what we saw up till now was from the Pacific .
this is from the Atlantic . even greater depth .
you can see this shrimp is harass@@ ing this poor little guy here , and he &apos;ll bat it away with his c@@ law . wh@@ ack !
and the same thing &apos;s going on over here .
what they &apos;re getting at is that -- on the back of this cr@@ ab -- the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals .
and what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals .
and the cr@@ abs do n&apos;t like it at all .
these long fil@@ aments that you see on the back of the cr@@ ab are actually created by the product of that bacteria .
so , the bacteria grows hair on the cr@@ ab .
on the back , you see this again .
the red dot is the laser light of the submarine Al@@ vin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents .
those are all shrimp .
you see the hot water over here , here and here , coming out .
they &apos;re cl@@ inging to a rock face and actually scrap@@ ing bacteria off that rock face .
here &apos;s a tiny , little vent that &apos;s come out of the side of that pillar .
those pillars get up to several stories .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes , inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
they do n&apos;t need the sun at all .
you see this white V-@@ shaped mark on the back of the shrimp ?
it &apos;s actually a light-@@ sensing organ .
it &apos;s how they find the hydro@@ thermal vents .
the vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature -- and so they &apos;re able to find these vents at considerable distances .
all this stuff is happening along that 4@@ 0,@@ 000-@@ mile long mountain range that we &apos;re calling the ribbon of life , because just even today , as we speak , there &apos;s life being generated there from volcanic activity .
this is the first time we &apos;ve ever tried this any place .
we &apos;re going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific .
we &apos;re moving up one of these pillars .
this one &apos;s several stories tall .
in it , you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s a habitat for a lot of different animals .
there &apos;s a funny kind of hot plate here , with vent water coming out of it .
so all of these are individual homes for worms .
now here &apos;s a closer view of that community .
here &apos;s cr@@ abs here , worms here .
there are smaller animals cra@@ wling around .
here &apos;s p@@ ago@@ da structures .
I think this is the ne@@ at@@ est-@@ looking thing .
I just ca n&apos;t get over this -- that you &apos;ve got these little chim@@ neys sitting here smoking away .
this stuff is toxic as hell , by the way .
you could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean , and it &apos;s coming out all from it .
it &apos;s unbelievable . it &apos;s basically sul@@ fur@@ ic acid , and it &apos;s being just dumped out , at incredible rates .
and animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here .
that &apos;s probably where we evolved from .
this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
although the vent sites are short-lived -- an individual site may last only 10 years or so -- as an ecosystem they &apos;ve been stable for millions -- well , billions -- of years .
it works too well . you see there &apos;re some fish inside here as well .
there &apos;s a fish sitting here .
here &apos;s a cr@@ ab with his c@@ law right at the end of that tube worm , waiting for that worm to stick his head out .
the bi@@ ologists right now can not explain why these animals are so active .
the worms are growing inches per week !
I already said that this site , from a human perspective , is toxic as hell .
not only that , but on top -- the lif@@ eb@@ lood -- that plum@@ bing system turns off every year or so .
their plum@@ bing system turns off , so the sites have to move .
and then there &apos;s earthquakes , and then volcanic eruptions , on the order of one every five years , that completely wi@@ pes the area out .
despite that , these animals grow back in about a year &apos;s time .
you &apos;re talking about bio@@ den@@ sities and biodiversity , again , higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life .
is it sensitive ? yes .
is it fragile ? no , it &apos;s not really very fragile .
I &apos;ll end up with saying one thing .
there &apos;s a story in the sea , in the waters of the sea , in the se@@ diments and the rocks of the sea floor .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
what we see when we look back in time , in those se@@ diments and rocks , is a record of Earth history .
everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms .
the continents move apart . they come back together .
oceans come and go . mountains come and go . glaciers come and go .
El N@@ ino comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s rhythmic .
what we &apos;re learning now , it &apos;s almost like a symphony .
it &apos;s just like music -- it really is just like music .
and what we &apos;re learning now is that you ca n&apos;t listen to a five-@@ billi@@ on-@@ year long symphony , get to today and say , `` Stop ! we want tomorrow &apos;s note to be the same as it was today . &apos;&apos;
it &apos;s absurd . it &apos;s just absurd .
so , what we &apos;ve got to learn now is to find out where this planet &apos;s going at all these different scales and work with it .
learn to manage it .
the concept of preservation is futile .
conservation &apos;s tougher , but we can probably get there .
thank you very much .
thank you .

&@@ lt@@ ; title &gt; Steve K@@ eil : a manifesto for play , for Bulgaria and beyond &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ title &gt;
&@@ lt@@ ; description &gt; Steve K@@ eil fights the `` serious m@@ eme &apos;&apos; that has infected his home of Bulgaria -- and calls for a return to play to revitali@@ ze the economy , education and society . a sparkling talk with a universal message for people everywhere who are re@@ inventing their workplaces , schools , lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; /@@ em &amp; gt ; &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ description &gt;
I &apos;m here today to start a revolution .
now before you get up in arms , or you break into song , or you pick a favorite color , I want to define what I mean by revolution .
by revolution , I mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think and behave -- the way we think and the way we behave .
now why , Steve , why do we need a revolution ?
we need a revolution because things are n&apos;t working ; they &apos;re just not working .
and that makes me really sad because I &apos;m sick and tired of things not working .
you know , I &apos;m sick and tired of us not living up to our potential .
I &apos;m sick and tired of us being last .
and we are last place in so many things -- for example , social factors .
we &apos;re last place in Europe in innovation .
there we are right at the end , right at the bottom , last place as a culture that does n&apos;t value innovation .
we &apos;re last place in health care , and that &apos;s important for a sense of well-being .
and there we are , not just last in the E.@@ U. , we &apos;re last in Europe , at the very bottom .
and worst of all , it just came out three weeks ago , many of you have seen it , The Economist .
we &apos;re the sad@@ dest place on Earth , relative to GDP per capita -- the sad@@ dest place on Earth .
that &apos;s social . let &apos;s look at education .
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the OECD ?
last in reading , math and science . last .
business : the lowest perception in the E.@@ U .
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society .
why as a result , what happens ?
the lowest percentage of entrepreneurs starting businesses .
and this is despite the fact that everybody knows that small business is the engine of economies .
we hire the most people ; we create the most taxes .
so if our engine &apos;s broken , guess what ?
last in Europe GDP per capita .
last .
so it &apos;s no surprise , guys , that 62 percent of Bulgarians are not optimistic about the future .
we &apos;re unhappy , we have bad education , and we have the worst businesses .
and these are facts , guys .
this is n&apos;t story tale ; it &apos;s not make-@@ believe .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria . these are facts .
so I think it should be really , really clear that our system is broken .
the way we think , the way we behave , our operating system of behaving is broken .
we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave to transform Bulgaria for the better , for ourselves , for our friends , for our family and for our future .
how did this happen ?
let &apos;s be positive now . we &apos;re going to get positive . how did this happen ?
I think we &apos;re last because -- and this is going to be drastic to some of you -- because we are handic@@ apping ourselves .
we &apos;re holding ourselves back because we do n&apos;t value play .
I said `` play , &apos;&apos; all right .
in case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
babies play , kids play , adults play .
we do n&apos;t value play .
in fact , we de@@ value play .
and we de@@ value it in three areas .
let &apos;s go back to the same three areas .
social : 45 years of what ?
of communism -- of valuing the society and the state over the individual and squ@@ ashing , inadvertently , creativity , individual self-@@ expression and innovation .
and instead , what do we value ?
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ?
to be serious .
to be really , really serious .
it did .
be serious .
I ca n&apos;t tell you how many times I &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
heaven forbid they play in the dirt , the kal , or even worse , lok@@ vi , water -- that will kill them .
I have been told by bab@@ as and dy@@ ados that we should n&apos;t let our kids play so much because life is serious and we need to train them for the seriousness of life .
we have a serious m@@ eme running through .
it &apos;s a social gene running through us .
it &apos;s a serious gene .
it &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s created what I call the `` bab@@ a factor . &apos;&apos;
and here &apos;s how it works .
step one : woman says , `` I want to have a baby . I@@ sk@@ am baby . &apos;&apos;
step two : we get the baby . Woo@@ ho@@ o !
but then what happens in step three ?
I want to go back to work because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees .
I &apos;m going to give be@@ b@@ ko to bab@@ a .
but we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been infected by the serious m@@ eme for 45 years .
so what happens ?
she passes that virus on to baby , and it takes a really , really , really long time -- as the red@@ wood trees -- for that serious m@@ eme to get out of our operating system .
what happens then ?
it goes into education where we have an antiqu@@ ated education system that has little changed for 100 years , that values rote learning , mem@@ orization and standardization , and de@@ values self-@@ expression , self-@@ exploration , questioning , creativity and play .
it &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
true story : I went looking for a school for my kid .
we went to this prestigious little school and they say they &apos;re going to study math 10 times a week and science eight times a week and reading five times a day and all this stuff .
and we said , `` Well what about play and recess ? &apos;&apos;
and they said , `` Ha . there wo n&apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &apos;&apos;
and we said , `` He &apos;s five . &apos;&apos;
what a crime . what a crime .
and it &apos;s a crime that our education system is so serious because education is serious that we &apos;re creating min@@ dless , robo@@ tic workers to put bolts in pre-@@ dri@@ lled holes .
but I &apos;m sorry , the problems of today are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution .
we need adaptability , the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative .
we do n&apos;t need mechan@@ ized workers .
but no , now our m@@ eme goes into work where we do n&apos;t value play .
we create robo@@ tic workers that we treat like assets , to lever and just throw away .
what are qualities of a Bulgarian work ?
autocratic -- do what I say because I &apos;m the chef .
I &apos;m the boss and I know better than you .
un@@ trusting -- you &apos;re obviously a criminal , so I &apos;m going to install cameras .
controlling -- you &apos;re obviously an idi@@ ot , so I &apos;m going to make a z@@ il@@ lion little processes for you to follow so you do n&apos;t step out of the box .
so they &apos;re restrictive -- do n&apos;t use your mobile phone , do n&apos;t use your laptop , do n&apos;t search the Internet , do n&apos;t be on I.@@ M .
that &apos;s somehow un@@ professional and bad .
and at the end of the day , it &apos;s un@@ fulfilling because you &apos;re controlled , you &apos;re restricted , you &apos;re not valued and you &apos;re not having any fun .
in social , in education and in our business , do n&apos;t value play .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re last , because we do n&apos;t value play .
and you can say , `` That &apos;s ridiculous , Steve . what a dum@@ b idea .
it ca n&apos;t be because of play .
just play , that &apos;s a stupid thing . &apos;&apos;
we have the serious m@@ eme in us .
well I &apos;m going to say no .
and I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech -- that play is the catalyst , it is the revolution , that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better .
play : our brains are hard@@ wired for play .
evolution has selected , over millions and billions of years , for play in animals and in humans .
and you know what ?
evolution does a really , really good job of des@@ electing traits that are n&apos;t advantageous to us and selecting traits for competitive advantage .
nature is n&apos;t stupid , and it selected for play .
throughout the animal kingdom , for example : ants . ants play .
maybe you did n&apos;t know that .
but when they &apos;re playing , they &apos;re learning the social order and dynamics of things .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
k@@ itt@@ ens play . we all know k@@ itt@@ ens play .
but what you may not know is that k@@ itt@@ ens deprived of play are unable to interact socially .
they can still hunt , but they ca n&apos;t be social .
bears play .
but what you may not know is that bears that play more survive longer .
it &apos;s not the bears that learn how to fish better .
it &apos;s the ones that play more .
and a final really interesting study -- it &apos;s been shown , a correlation between play and brain size .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
dolphins , pretty big brains , play a lot .
but who do you think with the biggest brains are the biggest players ?
yours truly : humans .
kids play , we play -- of every nationality , of every race , of every color , of every religion .
it &apos;s a universal thing -- we play .
and it &apos;s not just kids , it &apos;s adults too .
really cool term : ne@@ ot@@ en@@ y -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
and who are the biggest ne@@ ot@@ en@@ ists ?
humans . we play sports .
we do it for fun , or as Olymp@@ ians , or as professionals .
we play musical instruments .
we dance , we kiss , we sing , we just Go@@ of around .
we &apos;re designed by nature to play from birth to old age .
we &apos;re designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
it is a huge benefit .
just like there &apos;s benefits to animals , there &apos;s benefits to humans .
for example , it &apos;s been shown to stimulate neural growth in the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala , in the area where it controls emotions .
it &apos;s been shown to promote pre-@@ frontal cor@@ tex development where a lot of cogn@@ ition is happening .
as a result , what happens ?
we develop more emotional maturity if we play more .
we develop better decision-making ability if we play more .
these guys are facts .
it &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
these are the benefits to play .
it is a genetic birth@@ right that we have , like walking or speaking or seeing .
and if we handicap ourselves with play , we handicap ourselves as if we would with any other birth@@ right that we have .
we hold ourselves back .
little exercise just for a second : close your eyes and try to imagine a world without play .
imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
what does this world look like ?
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
it &apos;s pretty gl@@ um .
now imagine your workplace .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we &apos;re forward thinking .
is it fun ? is it playful ?
or is it cra@@ p ? is it autocratic , controlling , restrictive and un@@ trusting and un@@ fulfilling ?
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
we even feel guilty if we &apos;re seen playing at work .
`` Oh , my colleagues see me laughing . I must not have enough work , &apos;&apos; or , `` Oh , I &apos;ve got to hide because my boss might see me .
he &apos;s going to think I &apos;m not working hard . &apos;&apos;
but I have news for you : our thinking is backwards .
the opposite of play is not work .
the opposite of play is depression . it &apos;s depression .
in fact , play improves our work .
just like there &apos;s benefits for humans and animals , there &apos;s benefits for play at work .
for example , it stimulates creativity .
it increases our openness to change .
it improves our ability to learn .
it provides a sense of purpose and mastery -- two key motiv@@ ational things that increase productivity , through play .
so before you start thinking of play as just not serious , play does n&apos;t mean fri@@ vol@@ ous .
you know , the professional athlete that loves skiing , he &apos;s serious about it , but he loves it .
he &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
a doctor might be serious , but laughter &apos;s still a great medicine .
our thinking is backwards .
we should n&apos;t be feeling guilty .
we should be celebrating play .
quick example from the corporate world .
Fed@@ Ex , easy motto : people , service , profit .
if you treat your people like people , if you treat them great , they &apos;re happier , they &apos;re fulfilled , they have a sense of mastery and purpose .
what happens ? they give better service -- not worse , but better .
and when customers call for service and they &apos;re dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled , how do the customers feel ? they feel great .
and what do great customers do , great-@@ feeling customers ?
they buy more of your service and they tell more of their friends , which leads to more profit .
people , service , profit .
play increases productivity , not decreases .
and you &apos;re going to say , `` G@@ ee , that can work for Fed@@ Ex out there in the United States , but it ca n&apos;t work in Bulgaria .
no way . we &apos;re different . &apos;&apos;
it does work in Bulgaria , you guys . two reasons .
one , play is universal .
there &apos;s nothing weird about Bulgarians that we ca n&apos;t play , besides the serious m@@ eme that we have to kick out .
two , I &apos;ve tried it . I &apos;ve tried at Sci@@ ant .
when I got there , we had zero happy customers .
not one customer would refer us .
I asked them all .
we had marginal profit -- I did .
we had marginal profits , and we had unhappy stakeholders .
through some basic change , change like improving transparency , change like promoting self-@@ direction and collaboration , encouraging collaboration , not auto@@ cracy , the things like having a resul@@ ts-@@ focus .
I do n&apos;t care when you get in in the morning . I do n&apos;t care when you leave .
I care that your customer and your team is happy and you &apos;re organized with that .
why do I care if you get in at nine o&apos;clock ?
basically promoting fun .
through promoting fun and a great environment , we were able to transform Sci@@ ant and , in just three short years -- sounds like a long time , but change is slow -- every customer , from zero to every customer referring us , above average profits for the industry and happy stakeholders .
and you can say , `` Well how do you know they &apos;re happy ? &apos;&apos;
well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
independent analysis from anonymous employees on their surveys .
it does , and it can , work in Bulgaria .
there &apos;s nothing holding us back , except our own mentality about play .
so some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play .
first of all , you have to believe me .
if you do n&apos;t believe me , well just go home and think about it some more or something .
second of all , if you do n&apos;t have the feeling of play in you , you need to rediscover play .
whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy , that you enjoyed only six months ago , but now that you &apos;ve got that promotion you ca n&apos;t enjoy , because you feel like you have to be serious , rediscover it .
I do n&apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game .
rediscover that because you &apos;re the leaders , the innovation leaders , the thought leaders .
you &apos;re the ones that have to go back to the office or talk to your friends and ign@@ ite the fire of change in the play revolution .
you guys have to , and if you &apos;re not feeling it , your colleagues , your employees , are n&apos;t going to feel it .
you &apos;ve got to go back and say , `` Hey , I &apos;m going to trust you . &apos;&apos;
weird concept : I hired you ; I should trust you .
I &apos;m going to let you make decisions . I &apos;m going to empower you , and I &apos;m going to delegate to the lowest level , rather than the top .
I &apos;m going to encourage constructive criticism .
I &apos;m going to let you challenge authority .
because it &apos;s by challenging the way things are always done is that we are able to break out of the rut that we &apos;re in and create innovative solutions to problems of today .
we &apos;re not always right as leaders .
we &apos;re going to eradicate fear .
fear is the enemy of play .
and we &apos;re going to do things like eliminate restrictions .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid .
let them be on the Internet .
let them be on instant messen@@ gers .
let them take long lunches .
lunch is like the recess for work .
it &apos;s when you go out in the world and you recharge your brain , you meet your friends , you have a beer , you have some food , you talk , you get some synergy of ideas that maybe you would n&apos;t have had before .
let them do it . give them some freedom , and in general , let them play . let them have fun at the workplace .
we spend so much of our lives at the workplace , and it &apos;s supposed to be , what , a miserable grind , so that 20 years from now , we wake up and say , `` Is this it ?
is that all there was ? &apos;&apos;
unacceptable . Nep@@ ri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
so in summary , we need a drastic change in the way we think and behave , but we do n&apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
we do n&apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
what we need is a players &apos; uprising .
what we need is a players &apos; uprising .
what we need is a players &apos; uprising .
seriously , we need to band together .
today is the start of the uprising .
but what you need to do is fan the flames of the revolution .
you need to go and share your ideas and your success stories of what worked about reinvigor@@ ating our lives , our schools , and our work with play ; about how play promotes a sense of promise and self-@@ fulfillment ; of how play promotes innovation and productivity , and , ultimately , how play creates meaning .
because we ca n&apos;t do it alone . we have to do it together , and together , if we do this and share these ideas on play , we can transform Bulgaria for the better .
thank you .

&@@ lt@@ ; title &gt; Andreas Schleicher : use data to build better schools &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ title &gt;
&@@ lt@@ ; description &gt; How can we measure what makes a school system work ? Andreas Schleicher walks us through the P@@ ISA test , a global measurement that ranks countries against one another -- then uses that same data to help schools improve . watch to find out where your country stacks up , and learn the single factor that makes some systems out@@ perform others . &@@ lt@@ ; /@@ description &gt;
radical openness is still a distant future in the field of school education .
we have such a hard time fig@@ uring out that learning is not a place but an activity .
but I want to tell you the story of P@@ ISA , OECD &apos;s test to measure the knowledge and skills of 15-@@ year-@@ olds around the world , and it &apos;s really a story of how international comparisons have globalized the field of education that we usually treat Look at how the world looked in the 1960s , in terms of the proportion of people who had completed high school .
you can see the United States ahead of everyone else , and much of the economic success of the United States draws on its long-standing advantage as the first mo@@ ver in education .
but in the 1970s , some countries caught up .
in the 1980s , the global expansion of the talent pool continued .
and the world did n&apos;t stop in the 1990s .
so in the ` 60s , the U.S. was first .
in the ` 90s , it was 13th , and not because standards had fallen , but because they had risen so much faster elsewhere .
Korea shows you what &apos;s possible in education .
two generations ago , Korea had the standard of living of Afghanistan today , and was one of the lowest education performers .
today , every young Korean finishes high school .
so this tells us that , in a global economy , it is no longer national improvement that &apos;s the benchmark for success , but the best performing education systems internationally .
the trouble is that measuring how much time people spend in school or what degree they have got is not always a good way of seeing what they can actually do .
look at the toxic mix of unemployed graduates on our streets , while employers say they can not find the people with the skills they need .
and that tells you that better degrees do n&apos;t automatically translate into better skills and better jobs and better lives .
so with P@@ ISA , we try to change this by measuring the knowledge and skills of people directly .
and we took a very special angle to this .
we were less interested in whether students can simply reproduce what they have learned in school , but we wanted to test whether they can extra@@ pol@@ ate from what they know and apply their knowledge in novel situations .
now , some people have criticized us for this .
they say , you know , such a way of measuring outcomes is terribly unfair to people , because we test students with problems they have n&apos;t seen before .
but if you take that logic , you know , you should consider life unfair , because the test of truth in life is not whether we can remember what we learned in school , but whether we are prepared for change , whether we are prepared for jobs that have n&apos;t been created , to use technologies that have n&apos;t been invented , to solve problems we just ca n&apos;t anticipate today .
and once hot@@ ly contested , our way of measuring outcomes has actually quickly become the standard .
in our latest assessment in 2009 , we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy .
this chart shows you the performance of countries .
in red , sort of below OECD average .
yellow is so-@@ so , and in green are the countries doing really well .
you can see Shanghai , Korea , Singapore in Asia ; Finland in Europe ; Canada in North America doing really well .
three and a half school years between 15-@@ year-@@ olds in Shanghai and 15-@@ year-@@ olds in Chile , and the gap grows to seven school years when you include the countries with really poor performance .
there &apos;s a world of difference in the way in which young people are prepared for today &apos;s economy .
but I want to introduce a second important dimension into this picture .
educators like to talk about equity .
with P@@ ISA , we wanted to measure how they actually deliver equity , in terms of ensuring that people from different social backgrounds have equal chances .
and we see that in some countries , the impact of social background on learning outcomes is very , very strong .
opportunities are un@@ equally distributed .
a lot of potential of young children is wasted .
we see in other countries that it matters much less into which social context you &apos;re born .
we all want to be there , in the upper right quad@@ rant , where performance is strong and learning opportunities are equally distributed .
