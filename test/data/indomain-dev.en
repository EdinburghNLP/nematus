one day , Los Angeles Times colum@@ n@@ ist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an African-@@ American man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Do@@ w@@ ney Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Fo@@ xx as Nath@@ an@@ iel Anthony A@@ yers , the Ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ trained double b@@ assist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic afflic@@ tion with paranoid schizophren@@ ia .
Nath@@ an@@ iel dropped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Sk@@ id Ro@@ w in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the p@@ un -- in helping Nath@@ an@@ iel get off the streets .
I met Mr. A@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
he had just heard a performance of Beethoven &apos;s First and Fourth symph@@ onies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vial and greg@@ arious way about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dod@@ gers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the tre@@ acher@@ ous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
and we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nath@@ an@@ iel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , I should mention that Nath@@ an@@ iel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and Thor@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophren@@ ic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Sk@@ id Ro@@ w , exposed to its horrors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and Nath@@ an@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of man@@ ic g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and ar@@ peg@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of didac@@ tic violin pedagog@@ y .
so , I just started playing .
and I played the first movement of the Beethoven Viol@@ in Concerto .
and as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nath@@ an@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and Nath@@ an@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain sni@@ ppets of violin concer@@ tos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn , T@@ ch@@ ai@@ kovsky , Si@@ bel@@ ius .
and we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruck@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from Bart@@ รณ@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa-@@ Pek@@ ka Sal@@ onen .
and I understood that he not only had an en@@ cyclop@@ edic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , eru@@ dite , brilliant , Ju@@ illi@@ ard-@@ trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for Nath@@ an@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delu@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tor@@ mented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for Nath@@ an@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the rede@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and I will always make music with Nath@@ an@@ iel , whether we &apos;re at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Sk@@ id Ro@@ w , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : thank you . thanks .

Robert G@@ up@@ ta : I &apos;m going to play something that I sham@@ elessly st@@ ole from cell@@ ists .
so , please forgive me .
so , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ aty , a bes@@ tseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was far@@ m-@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
`` Absol@@ utely , &apos;&apos; I said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
nin@@ ety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ word@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
it &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it does n&apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
the day before the event , I called the head of P.@@ R. for the company .
let &apos;s call him Don .
`` Don , &apos;&apos; I said , `` just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you do n&apos;t pollute . &apos;&apos;
`` That &apos;s right , &apos;&apos; he said . `` We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &apos;&apos;
and then he added , `` We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &apos;&apos; he said .
`` Best in the business . &apos;&apos;
2.5 to one , great .
`` 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &apos;&apos;
`` Sustainable proteins , &apos;&apos; he said .
`` Great , &apos;&apos; I said . got off the phone .
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , `` Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &apos;&apos;
he said he did n&apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head bi@@ ologist .
let &apos;s call him Don too .
`` Don , &apos;&apos; I said , `` what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &apos;&apos;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
I said , `` Ch@@ icken pellets ? &apos;&apos;
he said , `` Ye@@ ah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scra@@ ps , dried and processed into feed . &apos;&apos;
I said , `` What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &apos;&apos;
thinking , you know , two percent .
`` Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &apos;&apos; he said .
I said , `` Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &apos;&apos;
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , `` There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &apos;&apos;
I fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m some self-@@ righteous , good@@ y-@@ two shoes Foo@@ die .
I actually am .
no , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swe@@ ar to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost sh@@ immer@@ ing , white color .
the chef had over@@ cooked it .
like twice over .
