a public , Dewey long ago observed , is constitu@@ ted through discussion and debate .
if we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question , and avoid Do@@ x@@ a , the realm of the un@@ questioned , then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion .
it is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time , name@@ ly , how to mobi@@ lize different forms of capital for the project of state building .
to put the assumptions very clearly : capitalism , after 150 years , has become acceptable , and so has democracy .
if we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capit@@ alist econo@@ mies and democratic poli@@ ties , they were the rare exception , not the nor@@ m .
the question now , however , is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation .
but we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions .
and that provides the ground for a type of action , because consensus of each moment allows us to act .
and it is necessary , no matter how fragile or how provi@@ sional our consensus , to be able to move forward .
but the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems .
most of the globe experiences the state as re@@ pre@@ ssive , as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights , about denial of justice , rather than pro@@ vision of it .
and in terms of experience of capitalism , there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences .
first , extrac@@ tive industry .
blood diamonds , smuggled emer@@ al@@ ds , ti@@ mber , that is cut right from under the poor@@ est .
second is technical assistance .
and technical assistance might shock you , but it 's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries .
next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7 , I express my deep sympathy , and before that , September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds .
we live in one world .
but that 's easily said .
but we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in . and that is that if we want to have one world , this one world can not be based on huge pockets of exclu@@ sion , and then inclu@@ sion for some .
we must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world , in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accoun@@ t@@ abilities that are truly global in scope .
otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history , where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics .
what is one of these organizations to pick ?
we have three critical terms : economy , civil society and the state .
I will not deal with those first two , except to say that un@@ critical transfer of assumptions , from one context to another , can only make for disaster .
economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context .
my country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia .
textbook economics does not work in my context , and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy .
the poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward , and not im@@ position of the fra@@ mework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling , for which I have enormous respect .
my colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best .
second , instead of debating end@@ lessly about what is the structure of the state , why do n't we simpli@@ fy and say , what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform ?
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this ; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure compar@@ a@@ tively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places .
so what are these functions ?
we propose 10 .
and it 's legitimate mono@@ poly of means of violence , administrative control , management of public finances , investment in human capital , pro@@ vision of citizenship rights , pro@@ vision of infrastructure , management of the tan@@ gible and int@@ an@@ gible assets of the state through regulation , creation of the market , international agreements , including public borrowing , and then , most importantly , rule of law .
I wo n't elaborate .
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity .
this is a f@@ easi@@ ble goal , basically because , contrary to widespread assumption , I would argue that we know how to do this .
who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 ?
but people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning .
and there are lots of other examples .
now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital .
the least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money .
money is not capital in most of the developing countries .
it 's just cash .
because it lacks the institu@@ tional , organi@@ z@@ ational , manag@@ erial forms to turn it into capital .
and what is required is a combination of physical capital , institu@@ tional capital , human capital -- and security , of course , is critical , but so is information .
now , the issue that should concern us here -- and that 's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again , it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B@@ .S. degree .
it takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D.
the first challenge is to rethink , fundamen@@ tally , the issue of the time .
do we need to repeat the mo@@ da@@ lities that we have inherited ?
our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century .
what is it that we need to do fundamen@@ tally to re@@ -@@ engage in a project , that capital formation is rapid ?
the absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster .
they need different ways of being approached ,
different ways of being en@@ franchi@@ sed ,
different ways of being skilled .
and that 's the first thing .
second is , you 're problem sol@@ vers , but you 're not engaging your global responsibility .
you 've stayed away from the problems of corruption .
you only want clean environments in which to function .
but if you do n't think through the problems of corruption , who will ?
you stay away from design for development .
you 're great designers , but your designs are selfish .
it 's for your own immediate use .
the world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads , or da@@ ms , or pro@@ vision of electricity that have not been re@@ visited in 60 years .
this is not right . it requires thinking .
but , particularly , what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a me@@ me is supposed to work .
as the work on para@@ dig@@ ms , long time ago showed -- Thomas Ku@@ hn 's work -- it 's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true break@@ thr@@ oughs -- occur .
and I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the em@@ power@@ ment of the majority of the world 's poor , through this means .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : so , Ash@@ ra@@ f , until recently , you were the finance minister of Afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda .
is the country gon na make it ?
will democracy fl@@ ourish ? what scares you most ?
Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ han@@ i : what scares me most is -- is you , lack of your engagement .
you asked me . you know I always give the un@@ conventional answer .
no . but seriously , the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as , at least , a 10@@ - to 20@@ -@@ year perspective .
today the world of glo@@ ba@@ lization is on speed .
time has been compressed .
and space does not exist for most people .
but in my world -- you know , when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years , space had expanded .
every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down .
I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12 .
so the first is when the scale is that , we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure .
in our world .
any meaningful sort of thing .
but the mo@@ da@@ lity of attention , or what is happening today , what 's happening tomorrow .
second is , when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense , brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years , 1@@ 10,000 strong ,
literally terrori@@ zing .
the sky : every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear .
we were bombed practically out of existence .
then , tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides .
the United States , Great Britain , joined for instance , Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism .
how to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror .
how to turn a donkey , a car@@ thor@@ se , anything .
and the Russians , equally .
so , when violence erup@@ ts in a country like Afghanistan , it 's because of that legacy .
but we have to understand that we 've been incredibly lucky .
I mean , I really ca n't believe how lucky I am here , standing in front of you , speaking .
when I joined as finance minister , I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent .
those were the risks . they were worth it .
I think we can make it , and the reason we can make it is because of the people .
you see , because , I mean -- I give you one stati@@ stic .
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan , 86 percent of the women , listen to at least three radio stations a day .
in terms of their disc@@ our@@ se , in terms of their sophi@@ sti@@ cation of knowledge of the world , I think that I would dare say , they 're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Euro@@ pe@@ ans --
because the world matters to them .
and what is their pre@@ dominant concern ?
aband@@ on@@ ment .
Afgh@@ ans have become deeply inter@@ nation@@ alist .
you know , when I went back in December of 2001 , I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
because I 'd lived as a nation@@ alist .
and I told them -- my people , with the Americans here -- separate .
Yes , I have an advi@@ sory position with the U.N. I went through 10 Afghan provin@@ ces very rapidly .
and everybody was telling me it was a different world .
you know , they engage .
they see engagement , global engagement , as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people .
and the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here , so I 'll recite a discussion she had with an il@@ literate woman in Northern Afghanistan .
and that woman said she did n't care whether she had food on her table .
what she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future , where her children could really have a different life .
that gives me hope .
ca : how is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ?
AG : certainly . well , the first is , instead of sending a billion dollars on drug era@@ di@@ cation and paying it to a couple of security companies , they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most cri@@ tically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs .
the key to the drug era@@ di@@ cation is jobs .
look , there 's a very little known fact : countries that have a legal average income per cap@@ ita of 1,000 dollars do n't produce drugs .
second , tex@@ tile .
trade is the key , not aid . the U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tari@@ ff .
the tex@@ tile industry is incredibly mobile .
if you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment , we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the tex@@ tile sector , if there was zero tari@@ ffs -- would create the type of job .
cotton does not compete with opium ; a t@@ -@@ shirt does .
and we need to understand , it 's the value chain .
look , the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about micro@@ credit .
it is important , but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro@@ -@@ production want is global access .
they do n't want to sell to the charity ba@@ za@@ ars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt emb@@ roi@@ dered time and again .
what we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms .
Yeah , we have the best emb@@ roi@@ der@@ ers in the world !
why ca n't we do what was done with northern Italy ?
with the Put Out system ?
so I think econo@@ mically , the critical issue really is to now think through .
and what I will say here is that aid does n't work .
you know , the aid system is broken .
the aid system does not have the knowledge , the vision , the ability .
I 'm all for it ; after all , I raised a lot of it .
Yeah , to be exact , you know , I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 2@@ 7.@@ 5 billion .
they did n't want to give us the money .
ca : and it still did n't work ?
AG : no . it 's not that it did n't work .
it 's that a dollar of private investment , in my judgment , is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid , in terms of the dynamic that it generates .
second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents ; it could be 20 cents ; or it could be four dollars .
it depends on what form it comes , what degrees of condi@@ tion@@ alities are attached to it .
you know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit entrep@@ rene@@ urs of the developed countries , not to generate growth in the poor countries .
and this is , again , one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we 've inherited in governments , and doors .
you would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsi@@ di@@ zing to function in developing countries , provide advice , but they do .
there 's an entire weight of history vi@@ s@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ vis aid that now needs to be re@@ examined .
if the goal is to build states that can credi@@ bly take care of themselves -- and I 'm putting that proposition equally ; you know I 'm very harsh on my counter@@ parts -- aid must end in each country in a defin@@ able period .
and every year there must be progress on mobi@@ lization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy .
unless that kind of compact is entered into , you will not be able to sustain the consensus .
what I want to talk about is , as background , is the idea that cars are art .
this is actually quite meaningful to me , because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the to@@ tem pole -- we do n't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it -- and cars are thought so much as a product that it 's a little bit difficult to get into the aes@@ thetic side under the same sort of termin@@ ology that one would discuss art .
and so cars , as art , brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that -- that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
now at this point you 're going to see a picture of Michelangelo .
this is completely different than auto@@ mobi@@ les .
auto@@ mobi@@ les are self@@ -@@ moving things , right ? elevators are auto@@ mobi@@ les .
and they 're not very emotional ; they solve a purpose ; and certainly auto@@ mobi@@ les have been around for 100 years and have made our lives func@@ tionally a lot better in many ways ; they 've also been a real pain in the ass ,
because auto@@ mobi@@ les are really the thing we have to solve .
we have to solve the pollution , we have to solve the con@@ gestion -- but that 's not what interests me in this speech . what interests me in this speech is cars . auto@@ mobi@@ les may be what you use , but cars are what we are , in many ways .
and as long as we can solve the problems of auto@@ mobi@@ les , and I believe we can , with fuel cells or hydrogen , like BMW is really hip on , and lots of other things , then I think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car@@ -@@ y@@ -@@ ness -- and what that means , what we can learn from it . that 's what I want to get to . cars are not a suit of clothes ; cars are an avatar . cars are an expansion of yourself : they take your thoughts , your ideas , your emotions , and they multiply it --
your anger , whatever . it 's an avatar .
it 's a super@@ -@@ wal@@ do that you happen to be inside of , and if you feel sexy , the car is sexy . and if you 're full of road rage , you 've got a `` Chevy : like a Rock , '' right ?
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?
that every car you see out there is scul@@ pted by hand .
many people think , `` Well , it 's computers , and it 's done by machines and stuff like that . ''
well , they reproduce it , but the origin@@ als are all done by hand .
it 's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft .
and they put that same kind of tension into the scul@@ pting of a car that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum .
that tension between the need to express , the need to discover , then you put something new into it , and at the same time you have bounds of crafts@@ manship .
rules that say , this is how you handle surfaces ; this is what control is all about ; this is how you show you 're a master of your craft .
and that tension , that discovery , that push for something new -- and at the same time , that sense of obligation that 's as strong in cars as it is in anything .
we work in clay , which has n't changed much since Michelangelo started screwing around with it , and there 's a very interesting analogy to that too .
real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he 's there to `` discover the figure within , '' OK ?
there we go , the automobile .
that was 100 years right there -- did you catch that ?
between that one there , and that one there , it changed a lot did n't it ?
OK , it 's not marketing ; there 's a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here .
I want to talk about this .
why it means you have to wash a car , what is it , that sen@@ su@@ ality you have to touch about it ? that 's the sculpture that goes into it . that sen@@ su@@ ality .
and it 's done by men and women working just like this , making cars .
now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore , I believe that that `` pressure within '' that Moore 's talking about -- at least when it comes to cars -- comes right back to this idea of the mean .
it 's that will to live , that need to survive , to express itself , that comes in a car , and takes over people like me .
and we tell other people , `` Do this , do this , do this , '' until this thing comes alive .
we are completely infected . and beauty can be the result of this infec@@ ti@@ ousness ; it 's quite wonderful .
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it 's really what puts the crafts@@ manship into our cars .
and it 's not a whole lot different , really , when they 're working like this , or when somebody works like this .
it 's that same kind of commitment , that same kind of beauty .
now , now I get to the point . I want to talk about cars as art .
art , in the Pla@@ tonic sense , is truth ; it 's beauty , and love .
now this is really where designers in car business diver@@ ge from the engineers .
we do n't really have a problem talking about love .
we do n't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense .
that 's what we 're searching for -- when we 're working our craft , we are really trying to find that truth out there .
we 're not trying to find vanity and beauty .
we 're trying to find the beauty in the truth .
however , engineers tend to look at things a little bit more New@@ tonian , instead of this quantum approach .
we 're dealing with ir@@ ration@@ ali@@ sms , and we 're dealing with para@@ do@@ xes that we admit exist , and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like two and two is four , and if you get 4.@@ 0 it 's better , and 4.@@ 000 is even better .
and that sometimes leads to bit of a diver@@ gence in why we 're doing what we 're doing .
we 've pretty much accepted the fact , though , that we are the women in the organization at BMW -- BMW is a very manly type business , -- men , men , men ; it 's engineers .
and we 're kind of the female side to that . that 's OK , that 's cool . you go off and be manly . we 're going to be a little bit more female .
because what we 're interested in is finding form that 's more than just a function .
we 're interested in finding beauty that 's more than just an aes@@ thetic ; it 's really a truth .
and I think this idea of soul , as being at the heart of great cars , is very appli@@ cable . you all know it . you know a car when you 've seen it , with soul . you know how strong this is .
well , this experience of love , and the experience of design , to me , are inter@@ chan@@ g@@ eable . and now I 'm coming to my story .
I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue .
and first of all , you have to go with me for a second , and say , you know , you could take the word `` love '' out of a lot of things in our society , put the word `` design '' in , and it still works , like this quote here , you know . it kind of works , you know ?
you can understand that . it works in tru@@ isms .
`` All is fair in design and war . ''
certainly we live in a competitive society .
I think this one here , there 's a pop song that really describes Philippe Star@@ ck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
toothbrush , cool .
it really only gets serious when you look at something like this . OK ?
this is one sub@@ stitution that I believe all of us , in design management , are guilty of .
and this idea that there is more to love , more to design , when it gets down to your neighbor , your other , it can be physical like this , and maybe in the future it will be .
but right now it 's in dealing with our own people , our own teams who are doing the creating . so , to my story .
the idea of peop@@ le@@ -@@ work is what we work with here , and I have to make a bond with my designers when we 're creating BM@@ W@@ s .
we have to have a shared intimacy , a shared vision -- that means we have to work as one family ; we have to understand ourselves that way .
there 's good times ; there 's interesting times ; and there 's some stress times too .
you want to do cars , you 've got to go outside .
you 've got to do cars in the rain ; you 've got to do cars in the snow .
that 's , by the way , is a presentation we made to our board of directors .
we haul their butts out in the snow , too . you want to know cars outside ?
well , you 've got to stand outside to do this .
and because these are artists , they have very artistic temper@@ am@@ ents .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is discovering yourself through your art . right ?
and one thing about cars is we 're all a little bit like Py@@ g@@ ma@@ lion , we are completely in love with our own crea@@ tions .
this is one of my favorite paintings , it really describes our relationship with cars .
this is sick beyond belief .
but because of this , the intimacy with which we work together as a team takes on a new dimension , a new meaning .
we have a shared center ; we have a shared focus -- that car stays at the middle of all our relationships .
and it 's my job , in the competitive process , to narrow this down .
I heard today about Joseph 's death genes that have to go in and kill cell re@@ production .
you know , that 's what I have to do sometimes .
we start out with 10 cars ; we narrow it down to five cars , down to three cars , down to two cars , down to one car , and I 'm in the middle of that killing , basically .
someone 's love , someone 's baby .
this is very difficult , and you have to have a bond with your team that permits you to do this , because their life is wrapped up in that too .
they 've got that gene infected in them as well , and they want that to live , more than anything else .
well , this project , Deep Blue , put me in contact with my team in a way that I never expected , and I want to pass it on to you , because I want you to reflect on this , perhaps in your own relationships .
we wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW .
we wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we 'd done it ,
that I only had a phone number that connected me to them .
so , what we did was : instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist , we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers to find out what 's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America .
this is 1996 we did this project . and so we sent them off with this team name , Deep Blue . now many people know Deep Blue from IBM -- we actually stole it from them because we figured if anybody read our fa@@ xes they 'd think we 're talking about computers .
it turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue , in a company like BMW , has a hook -- `` Deep Blue , '' wow , cool name .
so people get wrapped up in it . and we took a team of designers , and we sent them off to America . and we gave them a budget , what we thought was a set of deliver@@ ables , a timetable , and nothing else .
like I said , I just had a phone number that connected me to them .
and a group of engineers worked in Germany , and the idea was they would work separately on this problem of what 's the successor to the SUV . they would come together , compare notes . then they would work apart , come together , and they would produce together a monu@@ mental set of diverse opinions that did n't poll@@ ute each other 's ideas -- but at the same time came together and resolved the problems .
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in America . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
they disappeared , quite honestly , and all I got was postcards .
now , I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas , and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon , and I got these postcards of Ni@@ agara Falls , and pretty soon they 're in New York , and I do n't know where else .
and I 'm telling myself , `` This is going to be a great car , they 're doing research that I 've never even thought about before . ''
right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven apartments , it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor 's ex@@ -@@ house in Malibu .
and -- at least they told me it was her house , I guess it was at one time , she had a party there or something .
but anyway , this was the house , and they all lived there .
now this is 24 / 7 living , half@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ dozen people who 'd left their -- some had left their wives behind and families behind , and they literally lived in this house for the entire six months the project was in America , but the first three months were the most intensive .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the bathroom .
the bathroom was so big , she built the bed over the bathtub -- it 's quite fascinating .
on the other hand , I did n't know anything about this . OK ?
nothing . this is all going on , and all I 'm getting is postcards of these guys in Las Vegas , or whatever , saying , `` Do n't worry Chris , this is really going to be good . '' OK ?
so my concept of what a design studio was probably -- I was n't up to speed on where these guys were .
however , the engineers back in Munich had taken on this kind of New@@ tonian solution , and they were trying to find how many cup holders can dance on the head of a pin , and , you know , these really serious questions that are confron@@ ting the modern consumer .
and one was hoping that these two teams would get together , and this coll@@ u@@ sion of incredible creativity , under these incredible surroundings , and these incredibly stre@@ sse@@ d@@ -@@ out engineers , would create some incredible solutions .
well , what I did n't know was , and what we found out was -- these guys , they ca n't even like talk to each other under those conditions .
you get a diver@@ gence of New@@ tonian and quantum thinking at that point , you have a split in your dialog that is so deep , and so far , that they can not bring this together at all .
and so we had our first meeting , after three months , in Ti@@ bur@@ on , which is just up the road from here -- you know Ti@@ bur@@ on ?
and the idea was after the first three months of this independent research they would present it all to Dr. Go@@ sch@@ el -- who is now my boss , and at that time he was co@@ -@@ mentor on the project -- and they would present their results .
we would see where we were going , we would see the first indication of what could be the succe@@ ssive phenomenon to the SUV in America .
and so I had these ideas in my head , that this is going to be great .
I mean , I 'm going to see so much work , it 's so intense -- I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it , and I 'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either -- but somehow all this is going to come together , and I 'm going to see some really great product .
so we went to Ti@@ bur@@ on , after three months , and the team had gotten together the week before , many days ahead of time .
the engineers flew over , and designers got together with them , and they put their presentation together .
well , it turns out that the engineers had n't done anything .
and they had n't done anything because -- kind of , like in car business , engineers are there to solve problems , and we were asking them to create a problem .
and the engineers were waiting for the designers to say , `` This is the problem that we 've created , now help us solve it . ''
and they could n't talk about it . so what happened was , the engineers showed up with nothing .
and the engineers told the designers , `` If you go in with all your stuff , we 'll walk out , we 'll walk right out of the project . ''
so I did n't know any of this , and we got a presentation that had an agenda , looked like this .
there was a whole lot of dialog .
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .
and here I 'm expecting at any moment , `` OK , they 're going to turn the page , and I 'm going to see the cars , I 'm going to see the sketches , I 'm going to see maybe some idea of where it 's going . ''
dialog kept on going , with mental maps of words , and pretty soon it was becoming obvious that instead of being da@@ zzled with brilli@@ ance , I was seriously being ba@@ ffled with bullshit .
and if you can imagine what this is like , to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working , and they 're out there spending all this money , and they 're learning , and they 're doing all this stuff .
I went fucking ballistic , right ? I went nuts .
you can probably remember Ti@@ bur@@ on , it used to look like this .
after four hours of this , I stood up , and I took this team apart .
I screamed at them , I yelled at them , " What the hell are you doing ?
you 're letting me down , you 're my designers , you 're supposed to be the creative ones , what the hell is going on around here ? "
it was probably one of my better ti@@ rades , I have some good ones , but this was probably one of my better ones . and I went into these people ; how could they take BMW 's money , how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
because of course they did n't tell us that they had three station wagons full of drawings , model concepts , pictures -- everything I wanted , they 'd locked up in the cars , because they had shown soli@@ darity with the engineers -- and they 'd decided not to show me anything ,
in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start , because they had n't realized , of course , that they could n't do problem creating .
so we went to lunch -- And I 've got to tell you , this was one seriously quiet lunch .
the engineers all sat at one end of the table , the designers and I sat at the other end of the table , really quiet .
and I was just fucking furious , furious . OK ?
probably because they had all the fun and I did n't , you know .
that 's what you get furious about right ?
and somebody asked me about Catherine , my wife , you know , did she fly out with me or something ?
I said , `` No , '' and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife .
and I recalled that when Catherine and I were married , the priest gave a very nice sermon , and he said something very important .
he said , `` Love is not selfish , '' he said , " Love does not mean counting how many times I say , ' I love you . '
it does n't mean you had sex this many times this month , and it 's two times less than last month , so that means you do n't love me as much .
love is not selfish . `` And I thought about this , and I thought , '' You know , I 'm not showing love here . I 'm seriously not showing love .
I 'm in the air , I 'm in the air without trust .
this can not be . this can not be that I 'm expecting a certain number of sketches , and to me that 's my quanti@@ fication method for quali@@ fying a team .
this can not be . "
so I told them this story . I said , " Guys , I 'm thinking about something here , this is n't right . I ca n't have a relationship with you guys based on a premi@@ se that is a quanti@@ fiable one .
based on a dictate premi@@ se that says , ' I 'm a boss , you do what I say , without trust . ' "
I said `` This ca n't be . ''
actually , we all broke down into tears , to be quite honest about it , because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up inside of them , not being able to show me what I wanted , and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come .
and I think we felt much closer that day , we cut a lot of strings that did n't need to be there , and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we put the car back at the center of our thoughts , and we put love , I think , truly back into the center of the process .
by the way , that team went on to create six different concepts for the next model of what would be the proposal for the next generation after SU@@ Vs in America .
one of those was the idea of a cro@@ sso@@ ver cou@@ pes -- you see it downstairs , the X Cou@@ pe -- they had a lot of fun with that .
it was the ren@@ dition of our motorcycle , the GS , as Carl Mag@@ nu@@ sson says , `` bru@@ te@@ -@@ i@@ ful , '' as the idea of what could be a motorcycle , if you add two more wheels .
and so , in conclusion , my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you , was this one here . I 'm also going to steal a little quote out of `` Little Prince . ''
there 's a lot to be said about trust and love , if you know that those two words are sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous for design .
I had a very , very meaningful relationship with my team that day , and it 's stayed that way ever since .
and I hope that you too find that there 's more to design , and more towards the art of the design , than doing it yourself .
it 's true that the trust and the love , that makes it worthwhile .
thanks so much .
as you pointed out , every time you come here , you learn something .
this morning , the world 's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats , I think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people should n't sit down .
I could have told them that .
yesterday , the auto@@ motive guys gave us some new insights .
they pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff .
that 's reassuring .
they then pointed out that there 'd be , sort of , the other controls by wire , to get rid of all that mechanical stuff .
that 's pretty good , but why not get rid of the wires ?
then you do n't need anything to control the car , except thinking about it .
I would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what 's past the 15 minutes , I 'll be happy to talk to all the techno@@ -@@ geeks around here about what 's in here .
but if I had one thing to say about this , before we get to first , it would be that from the time we started building this , the big idea was n't the technology .
it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
the big idea here is , I think , a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation .
and maybe to put that in perspective : there 's so much data on this , I 'll be happy to give it to you in different forms .
you never know what strikes the fancy of whom , but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world . and Henry Ford , just about 100 years ago , started cran@@ king out Model Ts .
what I do n't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied .
for instance , in that time , 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns .
so , the car -- the horse@@ less carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage .
it was half as long .
and it was an environmental improvement , because , for instance , in 190@@ 3 they out@@ la@@ wed horses and bu@@ g@@ gies in downtown Manhattan , because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses , and a million of them urin@@ ating and doing other things , and the ty@@ pho@@ id and other problems created were almost unimagin@@ able .
so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy .
it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city .
it all made sense , with 91 percent of the people living there .
by the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system .
and it is certainly a wonder .
and by the way , as I take shots at old technologies , I want to assure everybody , and particularly the auto@@ motive industry -- who 's been very supportive of us -- that I do n't think this in any way compe@@ tes with airplanes , or cars .
but think about where the world is today .
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities .
that 's 3.@@ 2 billion people .
we 've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today .
500 years ago , sailing ships started getting reliable enough ; we found a new continent .
150 years ago , lo@@ co@@ motives got efficient enough , steam power , that we turned the continent into a country .
over the last hundred years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extra@@ ordinarily efficient way , and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that .
but during that entire process , more and more people have been born , and more and more people are moving to cities .
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half .
and so , nobody , I think , would argue that airplanes , in the last 50 years , have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood .
and if you just look at how technology has been applied , we 've solved all the long@@ -@@ range , high@@ -@@ speed , high@@ -@@ volume , lar@@ ge@@ -@@ weight problems of moving things around .
nobody would want to give them up .
and I certainly would n't want to give up my airplane , or my helicopter , or my Hum@@ vee , or my Porsche .
I love them all . I do n't keep any of them in my living room .
the fact is , the last mile is the problem , and half the world now lives in dense cities .
and people spend , depending on who they are , between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot .
I think there 's -- I do n't know what data would impress you , but how about , 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metro@@ politan areas in the United States .
three million people die every year in cities due to bad air , and almost all particu@@ late pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices , particularly sitting in cities .
and again , I say that not to attack any industry , I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane , and cars on high@@ ways moving 60 miles an hour are extra@@ ordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view .
and we all love our cars , and I do .
the problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blocks , it 's neither fun nor efficient nor productive .
it 's not sustainable .
if -- in China , in the year 1998 , 4@@ 17 million people used bi@@ cycles ; 1.@@ 7 million people used cars .
if five percent of that population became , quote , middle class , and wanted to go the way we 've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan , every six weeks -- it is n't sustainable environ@@ mentally ;
it is n't sustainable econo@@ mically -- there just ai n't enough oil --
and it 's not sustainable politically .
I mean , what are we fighting over right now ?
we can make it complicated , but what 's the world fighting over right now ?
so it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile , and it was dumb luck . we were working on i@@ BO@@ Ts ,
but once we made this , we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis . you do n't need the water .
or snow@@ mobi@@ les . you do n't need the snow .
or skiing . it 's just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
and every one of those industries , by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi@@ -@@ billi@@ on@@ -@@ dollar industry .
but rather than go license this off , which is what we normally do , it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology , but into an understanding of a world that 's solved all its other problems , but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which , right back from ancient Greece on , were meant to walk around , cities that were archit@@ ected and built for people -- now have a footprint that ,
while we 've solved every other transportation problem --
and it 's like Moore 's law .
I mean , look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Con@@ e@@ sto@@ ga wagon , then on a railroad , then an airplane .
every other form of transportation 's been improved .
in 5,000 years , we 've gone backwards in getting around cities .
they 've gotten bigger ; they 're spread out .
the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wil@@ shire Boulevard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their down@@ towns .
the 20 largest cities in the world .
so you wonder , what if cities could give to their pedestri@@ ans what we take for granted as we now go between cities ?
what if you could make them fun , attractive , clean , environ@@ mentally friendly ?
what if it would make it a little bit more pal@@ at@@ able to have access via this , as that last link to mass transit , to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want , and then have our cities ener@@ gi@@ zed again ?
we thought it would be really neat to do that , and one of the problems we really were worried about is : how do we get legal on the sidewalk ? because technically I 've got mo@@ tors ; I 've got wheels -- I 'm a motor vehicle .
I do n't look like a motor vehicle .
I have the same footprint as a pedestri@@ an ; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestri@@ ans in a crowded space .
I took this down to G@@ round Zero , and knocked my way through crowds for an hour .
I 'm a pedestri@@ an . but the law typically la@@ gs technology by a generation or two , and if we get told we do n't belong on the sidewalk , we have two choices .
we 're a recrea@@ tional vehicle that does n't really matter , and I do n't spend my time doing that kind of stuff .
or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Grey@@ hound bus or a vehicle .
we 've been so concerned about that , we went to the Po@@ st@@ master General of the United States , as the first person we ever showed on the outside , and said , " Put your people on it . everybody trusts their post@@ man .
and they belong on the side@@ walks , and they 'll use it seriously . "
he agreed . we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . they love it .
and I ca n't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket .
so we 've been working really , really hard ,
but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what 's important , and how to apply the technology .
we went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted .
so , I 'm happy , really , I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want .
and yes , it 's really fun , and yes , you should all go out and try it .
but if I could ask you to do one thing , it 's not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just imagine that , although we all understand somehow that it 's reasonable that we use our 4,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ pound machine , which can go 60 miles an hour , that can bring you everywhere you want to go , and somehow it 's also what we used for the last mile , and it 's broken , and it does n't work .
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in California . a few weeks ago , after we launched it , we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach , zi@@ pping up and back , and he 's marvel@@ ing at the technology , and meanwhile bi@@ cycles are zi@@ pping by , and skate@@ boar@@ ders are zi@@ pping by , and a little old lady -- I mean , if you looked in the dictionary , a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I 'm on this , I 'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops , and the camera is there , and she looks up at me
and says , `` Can I try that ? ''
and what was I -- you know , how are you going to say anything ?
and so I said , `` Sure . ''
so I get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usual , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 feet , and she turns back around , and she 's all smiles .
and she comes back to me and she stops , and she says , `` Finally , they made something for us . ''
and the camera is looking down at her .
I 'm thinking , `` Wow , that was great -- -- please lady , do n't say another word . ''
and the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , `` What do you mean by that ? ''
and I figured , `` It 's all over now , '' and she looks up and she says , `` Well , '' she 's still watching these guys go ; she says , `` I ca n't ride a bike , '' no , she says , `` I ca n't use a skateboard , and I 've never used roller blades , '' she knew them by name ; she says , `` And it 's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle . ''
then she looks up , she 's looking up , and she says , `` And I 'm 81 years old , and I do n't drive a car anymore . I still have to get to the store , and I ca n't carry a lot of things . ''
and it suddenly occurred to me , that among my many fears , were not just that the bureau@@ cracy and the regu@@ lators and the legisla@@ tors might not get it -- it was that , fundamen@@ tally , you believe there 's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left , the side@@ walks in these cities .
but she looks up and says this , and it occurs to me , well , kids are n't going to mind these things , and they do n't vote , and business people and then young adults are n't going to mind these things -- they 're pretty cool -- so I guess subli@@ min@@ ally I was worried that it 's the older population that 's going to worry .
so , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regu@@ latory guys , call A@@ AR@@ P , get an appointment right away .
we 've got to show them this thing .
and they took it to Washington ; they showed them ; and they 're going to be involved now , watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities , like Atlanta , where we 're doing trials to see if it really can , in fact , help re@@ -@@ ener@@ gize their downtown .
the bottom line is , whether you believe the United Nations , or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years , all human population growth on this planet will be in cities .
in Asia alone , it will be over a billion people .
they learned to start with cell phones .
they did n't have to take the 100@@ -@@ year trip we took .
they start at the top of the technology food chain .
we 've got to start building cities and human environments where a 15@@ 0@@ -@@ pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green@@ -@@ space environment , without being in a 4,@@ 00@@ 0@@ -@@ pound machine to do it .
cars were not meant for parallel parking ;
they 're wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it :
we 've solved all the long@@ -@@ range , high@@ -@@ speed problems .
the Greeks went from the theater of Di@@ ony@@ sus to the Par@@ the@@ non in their sandals .
you do it in your sneakers .
not much has changed .
if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30@@ -@@ minute walk becomes 10 minutes .
your choice , when living in a city , if it 's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative , whether it 's a bus , a train --
we 've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you 're going to keep parking those cars .
but if you could put a pin in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one half@@ -@@ hour , it 's the city .
if you could make it fun , and make it eight or 10 minutes , you ca n't find your car , un@@ -@@ park your car , move your car , re@@ -@@ park your car and go somewhere ;
you ca n't get to a cab or a subway .
we could change the way people allo@@ cate their resources , the way this planet uses its energy ,
make it more fun .
and we 're hoping to some extent history will say we were right .
that 's Se@@ g@@ way . this is a Sti@@ r@@ ling cycle engine ; this had been confused by a lot of things we 're doing .
this little beast , right now , is producing a few hundred wa@@ tts of electricity .
Yes , it could be attached to this , and yes , on a kilo@@ gram of prop@@ ane , you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose .
perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it 'll burn any fuel , because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact , where most of the world you ca n't simply plug into your 120@@ -@@ vo@@ lt outlet .
we 've been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with Johnson & Johnson , to run an i@@ bot , because the best batteries you could get -- 10 wa@@ tt@@ -@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lead , 20 wa@@ tt@@ -@@ hours per kilo@@ gram nick@@ el@@ -@@ cad@@ mi@@ um , 40 wa@@ tt@@ -@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in nick@@ el@@ -@@ metal hy@@ dri@@ de , 60 wa@@ tt@@ -@@ hours per kilo@@ gram in lithium , 8,@@ 750 wa@@ tt@@ -@@ hours of energy in every kilo@@ gram of prop@@ ane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars .
but , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it 's external combu@@ stion -- as your kitchen stove , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty neat .
it makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb .
but more interest@@ ingly , the thermo@@ dynamics of this say , you 're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency .
it does n't matter much -- it says if you get 200 wa@@ tts of electricity , you 'll get 700 or 800 wa@@ tts of heat .
if you wanted to boil water and re@@ -@@ con@@ dense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour , it takes about 25 , a little over 2@@ 5.@@ 3 kilo@@ wa@@ tt -- 25,000 wa@@ tts of continuous power -- to do it . that 's so much energy , you could n't afford to de@@ sal@@ in@@ ate or clean water in this country that way .
certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to deva@@ state the place , turning everything that will burn into heat , or drink the water that 's available .
the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water .
depending on whose numbers you believe , it 's between 60 and 8@@ 5,000 people per day . we do n't need sophisticated heart transp@@ lants around the world .
we need water .
and women should n't have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
we figured out how to put a va@@ por@@ -@@ compression di@@ sti@@ ller on this thing , with a counter@@ -@@ flow heat ex@@ changer to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 450 wa@@ tts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 gallons an hour of di@@ sti@@ lled water from anything that comes into it to cool it .
so if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drin@@ kable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ?
I do n't know , but we 'll try it .
I better shut up .
I want to start off by saying , Houston , we have a problem .
we 're entering a second generation of no progress in terms of human flight in space . in fact , we 've regre@@ ssed .
we stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth to go out and continue this very important thing that we as a species have always done .
and that is , instin@@ ctively we 've gone out and climbed over difficult places , went to more hostile places , and found out later , maybe to our surprise , that that 's the reason we survived .
and I feel very strongly that it 's not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it 's OK to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to coloni@@ zation ; they need to look forward to break@@ thr@@ oughs .
we need to inspire them , because they need to lead us and help us survive in the future .
I 'm particularly troubled that what NASA 's doing right now with this new Bush doc@@ trine to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot , I screwed up .
we have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics .
what we 're looking forward to is -- what we 're looking forward to is not only the inspiration of our children , but the current plan right now is not really even allowing the most creative people in this country -- the Bo@@ eing 's and Lock@@ heed 's space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff .
we 're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later ? and we 're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new .
I 'm really troubled by that . but anyway that 's -- the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
that 's the theme of my next 15 minutes here .
and I think that the inspiration begins when you 're very young : three@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds , up to 12@@ - , 14@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ olds .
what they look at is the most important thing .
let 's take a sna@@ p@@ shot at avi@@ ation .
and there was a wonderful little short four@@ -@@ year time period when marvelous things happened .
it started in 190@@ 8 , when the Wright brothers flew in Paris , and everybody said , `` Ooh , hey , I can do that . '' There 's only a few people that have flown in early 190@@ 8 . in four years , 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes , thousand of pilots . airplanes were invented by natural selection .
now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today , but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes .
there were probably at least 30,000 different things tried , and when they crash and kill the pilot , do n't try that again .
the ones that flew and landed OK because there were no trained pilots who had good flying qualities by definition .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attempts , thousands of attempts , in that four@@ -@@ year time period , we invented the concepts of the airplanes that we fly today . and that 's why they 're so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what 's good .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
there 's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians .
well , who was inspired during that time period ?
avi@@ ation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought were the mo@@ vers and sha@@ kers of the first 100 years of avi@@ ation .
and I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful ren@@ aissance of avi@@ ation .
well , what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too .
the jet age started : the missile age started . von Bra@@ un was on there showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Spu@@ t@@ nik .
and this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting than it is now . we thought there 'd be animals there ; we knew there were plants there ; the colors change , right ?
but , you know , NASA screwed that up because they 've sent these robots and they 've landed it only in the deser@@ ts .
if you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew , and the red line is top@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ line military fighters and the blue line is commercial air transport .
you notice here 's a big jump when I was a little kid -- and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage to go out and try something that other people were n't having the courage to try .
well , what did I do when I was a kid ?
I did n't do the ho@@ tro@@ ds and the girls and the dancing
and , well , we did n't have drugs in those days . but I did competition model airplanes .
I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War fli@@ ght@@ -@@ testing airplanes for the Air Force .
and then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes that people could build in their gar@@ ages .
and some 3,000 of those are flying . of course , one of them is around the world Voyager . I founded another company in ' 82 , which is my company now .
and we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982 .
and there 's a lot of them that I actually ca n't show you on this chart .
the most impressive airplane ever , I believe , was designed only a dozen years after the first operational jet .
stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly , taken out of service .
we re@@ treated in ' 98 back to something that was developed in ' 56 . what ?
the most impressive spaceship ever , I believe , was a Gru@@ m@@ man Lun@@ ar L@@ ander . it was a -- you know , it landed on the moon , take off of the moon , did n't need any maintenance guys -- that 's kind of cool .
we 've lost that capability . we abandoned it in ' 72 .
this thing was designed three years after G@@ ag@@ arin first flew in space in 1961 .
three years , and we ca n't do that now . crazy .
talk very briefly about innovation cycles , things that grow , have a lot of activity ; they die out when they 're replaced by something else .
these things tend to happen every 25 years .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the D@@ C@@ 8 that was done in 1958 .
here 's the biggie , and that is , you do n't have innovation cycles if the government develo@@ ps and the government uses it .
you know , a good example , of course , is the DAR@@ PA net .
computers were used for artillery first , then IRS .
but when we got it , now you have all the level of activity , all the benefit from it . private sector has to do it .
keep that in mind . I put down innovation --
I 've looked for innovation cycles in space ; I found none .
the very first year , starting when G@@ ag@@ arin went in space , and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd , there were five manned space flights in the world -- the very first year .
in 2003 , everyone that the United States sent to space was killed .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
in 2004 , there were only two flights : two Russian So@@ yu@@ z flights to the international manned station . and I had to fly three in Mo@@ ja@@ ve with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five , which was the number the same year back in 1961 .
there is no growth . there 's no activity . there 's no nothing .
this is a picture here taken from Sp@@ ace@@ Shi@@ p@@ One .
this is a picture here taken from orbit .
our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that .
we know how to do it for sub@@ -@@ orbital flying now , do it safe enough -- at least as safe as the early air@@ lines -- so that can be done .
and I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage to go out and try that as a small company .
well , first of all , what 's going to happen next ?
the first industry will be a high volume , a lot of players .
there 's another one announced just last week .
and it will be sub@@ -@@ orbital . and the reason it has to be sub@@ -@@ orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
that 's -- You do n't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record .
it 'll be very high volume ; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020 .
I ca n't tell you when this will start , because I do n't want my competition to know my schedule . but I think once it does , we will find solutions ,
and very quickly , you 'll see those resort hotels in orbit .
and that real easy thing to do , which is a swing around the moon so you have this cool view . and that will be really cool . because the moon does n't have an atmosphere -- you can do an elli@@ ptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want .
Oh , it 's going to be so much fun .
OK . my critics say , " Hey , Ru@@ tan 's just spending a lot of these billi@@ on@@ aires ' money for joy@@ rides for billi@@ on@@ aires .
what 's this ? this is not a transportation system ; it 's just for fun . "
and I used to be bothered by that , and then I got to thinking ,
well , wait a minute . I bought my first Apple computer in 1978 and I bought it because I could say , " I got a computer at my house and you do n't .
' what do you use it for ? ' come over . it does Fro@@ gger . " OK .
not the bank 's computer or Lock@@ heed 's computer , but the home computer was for games .
for a whole decade it was for fun -- we did n't even know what it was for .
but what happened , the fact that we had this big industry , big development , big improvement and capability and so on , and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention .
and the inventor is in this audience .
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that , something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me -- a whole decade for fun , became everything -- our commerce , our research , our communication and , if we let the Google guys think for another couple weekends , we can add a dozen more things to the list .
and it wo n't be very long before you wo n't be able to convince kids that we did n't always have computers in our homes .
so fun is defen@@ dable .
OK , I want to show you kind of a busy chart , but in it is my prediction with what 's going to happen .
and in it also brings up another point , right here .
there 's a group of people that have come forward -- and you do n't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward were inspired as young children , this little three@@ - to 15@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old age , by us going to orbit and going to the moon here , right in this time period .
Paul Allen , E@@ lan Mu@@ sk , Richard Branson , Jeff Be@@ z@@ os , the An@@ sar@@ i family , which is now funding the Russians ' sub@@ -@@ orbital thing , Bob Bi@@ ge@@ low , a private space station , and Car@@ mack .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and I think it 's a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they 're putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and I think eventually it will allow us to coloni@@ ze and to keep us from going extinct .
they were inspired by big progress . but look at the progress that 's going on after that .
there were a couple of examples here .
the military fighters had a -- high@@ est@@ -@@ performance military airplane was the S@@ R@@ 71 . it went a whole life cycle , got too rusty to fly , and was taken out of service . the Con@@ cor@@ de doubled the speed for airline travel .
it went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . and we 're stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late ' 50s .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now . and I 'm talking about if you 've got a baby now , or if you 've got a 10@@ -@@ year@@ -@@ old now .
what 's out there is there 's something really interesting going to happen here .
relatively soon , you 'll be able to buy a ticket and fly higher and faster than the high@@ est@@ -@@ performance military operational airplane . it 's never happened before .
the fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance has been , well , you know , you win the war in 12 minutes ; why do you need something better ?
but I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying sub@@ -@@ orbital flights to space , very soon -- wait a minute , what 's happening here , we 'll have military fighters with sub@@ -@@ orbital capability , and I think very soon this .
but the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first .
OK , I look forward to a new `` capit@@ alist 's space race , '' let 's call it .
you remember the space race in the ' 60s was for national presti@@ ge , because we lost the first two mi@@ le@@ stones .
we did n't lose them technically . the fact that we had the hardware to put something in orbit when we let Von Bra@@ un fly it -- you can argue that 's not a technical loss .
Spu@@ t@@ nik was n't a technical loss , but it was a presti@@ ge loss .
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology , and that was a very strong thing .
and then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after G@@ ag@@ arin , not months or decades , or whatever . so we had the capability .
but America lost . we lost . and because of that , we made a big jump to recover it .
well , again , what 's interesting here is we 've lost to the Russians on the first couple of mi@@ le@@ stones already .
you can not buy a ticket commer@@ cially to fly into space in America --
ca n't do it . you can buy it in Russia .
you can fly with Russian hardware . this is available because a Russian space program is starving , and it 's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats .
it 's commercial . it can be defined as space touri@@ sm . they are also offering a trip to go on this whip around the moon , like Apollo 8 was done .
100 million bucks -- hey , I can go to the moon .
but , you know , would you have thought back in the ' 60s , when the space race was going on , that the first commercial capit@@ a@@ list@@ -@@ like thing to do to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware ?
and would you have thought , would the Russians have thought , that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware , the guys inside wo n't be Russians ? maybe it 'll probably be a Japanese or an American billionaire ? well , that 's weird : you know , it really is .
but anyway , I think we need to beat them again .
I think what we 'll do is we 'll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we 're first or not really does n't matter .
the Russians actually flew a su@@ person@@ ic transport before the Con@@ cor@@ de .
and then they flew a few cargo flights , and took it out of service .
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel when the commercial stuff is offered .
OK , we 'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight .
this little thing says here : five times what NASA 's doing by 2020 . I want to tell you , already there 's about 1.5 billion to 1.@@ 7 billion investment in private space flight that is not government at all -- already , worldwide . if you read -- if you Google it , you 'll find about half of that money , but there 's twice of that being committed out there -- not spent yet , but being committed and planned for the next few years . Hey , that 's pretty big .
I 'm predi@@ cting , though , as profitable as this industry is going to be -- and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost , or less -- this is going to be very profitable .
I predict , also , that the investment that will flow into this will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpa@@ yer spends for NASA 's manned spacecraft work .
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more effici@@ ently by a factor of 10 to 15 . and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no taxpa@@ yer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current NASA bud@@ gets for human space flight .
and that is because it 's us . it 's private industry .
you should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff -- and we 've done it for a long time . the N@@ AC@@ A , before NASA , never developed an air@@ liner and never ran an airline .
but NASA is developing the space liner , always has , and runs the only space line , OK . and we 've shi@@ ed away from it because we 're afraid of it . but starting back in June of 2004 , when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it , can get a start with it , everything changed after that time .
OK , thank you very much .
Kurt Ander@@ sen : like many architects , David is a hog for the lime@@ light but is suffici@@ ently reti@@ cent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking . in fact what we 're going to talk about , I think , is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address .
and I guess we have a bit of news clip to prece@@ de .
Dan Ra@@ ther : since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center , many people have flo@@ cked to downtown New York to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16@@ -@@ acre burial ground .
now , as CBS 's Jim Ax@@ el@@ rod reports , they 're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene .
Jim Ax@@ el@@ rod : forget the Empire State Building or the Statu@@ e of Liberty .
there 's a new place in New York where the crowds are thick@@ est -- G@@ round Zero .
tourist : I 've taken my step@@ -@@ daughter here from Indi@@ an@@ apo@@ lis .
this was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City -- this was her nu@@ mber@@ -@@ one pick . ja : thousands now line up on lower Broadway .
tourist : I 've been wanting to come down here since this happened .
ja : even on the col@@ dest winter days .
to honor and remember .
tourist : it 's reality , it 's us . it happened here .
this is ours .
ja : so many , in fact , that seeing has become a bit of a problem .
tourist : I think that people are very frustrated that they 're not able to get closer to see what 's going on .
ja : but that is about to change .
in record time , a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer .
man : they 'll get an incredible pan@@ or@@ ama and understand , I think more completely , the sheer to@@ tality of the destruction of the place .
ja : if you think about it , G@@ round Zero is unlike most any other tourist site in America .
unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Mon@@ u@@ ment , people come here to see what 's no longer there .
David Rock@@ well : the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground .
ja : the walls are bare by design , so people can fill them with their own memor@@ i@@ als the way they already have along the current perimeter .
tourist : from our hearts , it affected us just as much .
ja : the ra@@ mps are made of simple material -- the kind of pl@@ ywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point .
in the face of America 's worst destruction people are building again .
Jim Ax@@ el@@ rod , CBS News , New York .
ka : this is not an obvious subject to be in the sen@@ su@@ ality segment , but certainly David you are known as -- I know , a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect .
your work is highly sen@@ sual , even he@@ don@@ i@@ stic .
Dr : I like that word .
ka : it 's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants .
how did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York -- felt on the 11th of September trans@@ mute into your desire to do this thing ?
Dr : well the truth of the matter is , post@@ -@@ September 11th , I felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in Tri@@ be@@ ca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm , to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating .
in fact we 're finishing a book which is called `` Pleasure , '' which is about sen@@ sual pleasure in spaces .
but I 've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that .
we were really paralyzed .
and I found myself the Friday after September 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything .
we gave the office a few days off .
and in discussing this with other architects , we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller .
and I thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound .
and I had a series of discussions -- first with Rick Sco@@ fi@@ dio and Liz Di@@ ller , who collabor@@ ated with us on this , and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something .
and that as people who create places , the ultimate way to help was n't to pon@@ ti@@ fi@@ cate or to make up scenarios , but to help right now .
so we tried to come up with a way , as a group , to have a kind of design SWAT team .
and that was the mission that we came up with .
ka : were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs ?
Dr : well what I was aware of was , there was this overwhelming need to act now .
and we were asked to participate in a few projects before this .
there was a school , PS 2@@ 34 , that had been evacuated down at G@@ round Zero .
they moved to an abandoned school .
we took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists , and over four days -- it was like this urban bar@@ n@@ -@@ raising -- to reno@@ vate it , and everyone wanted to help .
it was just extraordinary .
Tom O@@ tter@@ ness contributed , Ma@@ ira Kal@@ man contributed and it became this ca@@ th@@ ar@@ tic experience for us .
ka : and that was done , effectively , by October 8 or something ?
Dr : Yeah .
ka : obviously , what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you 've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly by@@ z@@ an@@ tine , en@@ tren@@ ched bureau@@ cracy and powers that be in New York real estate and New York politics . Dr : well , it 's a funny thing .
we finished PS 2@@ 34 , and had dinner with a small group .
I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an A@@ IA committee to rebuild .
and I sat in on several meetings .
and there were the most circu@@ it@@ ous grand plans that had to do with long@@ -@@ term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city .
and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled , and there was talk about inclu@@ sion and wanting it to be an inclu@@ sive process .
and it was n't an inclu@@ sive group .
so we said , what is -- K@@ A : it was not an inclu@@ sive group ?
Dr : it was not an inclu@@ sive group .
it was pre@@ domin@@ antly a white , rich , corporate group that was not representative of the city .
ka : shocking .
Dr : Yeah , surprising .
so Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea .
the city actually approached us .
we first approached the city about Pi@@ er 94 .
we saw how PS 2@@ 34 worked .
the families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly de@@ humani@@ zing .
ka : on the Hudson River ?
Dr : Yeah . and the city actually -- through Tim Z@@ ag@@ at initially , and then through Christ@@ yne Nicholas , then we got to Giu@@ li@@ ani -- said , `` You know we do n't want to do anything with Pi@@ er 94 right now , but we have an observation platform for the families down at G@@ round Zero that we 'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families , and a way to protect it from the weather . ''
so I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin , and I 've got to say , it was the most moving experience of my life .
it was devastating to see the simple pl@@ ywood platform with a rail around it , where the families of the victims had left notes to them .
and there was no medi@@ ation between us and the experience .
there was no filter .
and I remembered on September 11th , on 14th Street , the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers pro@@ min@@ ently -- and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up .
and then everyone was up on the roof , so I ran up there .
and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on TV .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
so seeing this in a very simple , dignified way was a very powerful experience .
so we went back to the city and said we 're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform , but we 've spent some time down there .
at the same time the city had this need .
they were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there , that had nowhere to go .
and there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site .
so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan .
there was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site .
ka : but then you 've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing .
it looks like a fairly simple thing , but this was a half a million dollar project ?
Dr : well , we knew that if it was n't privately funded , it was n't going to happen .
and we also , frankly , knew that if it did n't happen by the end of the Giu@@ li@@ ani administration , then everyone who we were dealing with at the DO@@ T and the Police Department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time , and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management .
this incredible act on their part , because they really wanted this , and they sensed that this needed to happen .
ka : and there was therefore this ticking clock , because Giu@@ li@@ ani was obviously out three months after that .
Dr : Yeah . so the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims , through the city , to make sure that they knew this was happening .
because this did n't want to be a surprise .
and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York , because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible .
we came up with the idea of setting up a foundation , mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this , he would not agree to do this , even if we would pay him the money .
there needed to be a foundation in place .
so we came up with a foundation , and actually what happened was one major developer in New York -- K@@ A : who shall remain name@@ less , I guess ?
Dr : Yeah . his initials are J@@ S , and he owns Rockef@@ eller Center , if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help .
and we met with him .
the prices from the contractors were between five to 70@@ 0,000 dollars .
and Atlan@@ ti@@ c@@ -@@ Hey@@ dt , who 's the largest sca@@ f@@ folding contractor in the country , volunteered to do it at cost .
so this developer said , `` You know what , we 'll under@@ write the entire expense . ''
and we said , `` That 's incredible ! ''
and I think this was the 21st , and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th . and we had to start construction the next day .
we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice , and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it .
ka : sort of like the Spin@@ al Ta@@ p scene where you get the tiny little Stone@@ hen@@ ge , I guess ?
Dr : in fact , it was as if this was going to be win@@ dow@@ -@@ washing sca@@ f@@ folding .
there was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul -- that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified , and a place to reflect and remember .
and I 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together , watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site .
and I live down there , so we spent a lot of time looking at the need .
and I think people were amazed at two things -- I think they were amazed at the destruction , but I think there was a sense of dis@@ belief about the hero@@ ics of New Yor@@ kers that I found very moving .
just the sort of everyday hero@@ ics of New Yor@@ kers .
so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said , `` I 'm going to lock the door , because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this . ''
and we said , " Well , this is half the size , it does n't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city .
we 'd have to go back to the beginning to do this . "
and I convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed .
the next day I got an email from the developer saying that he was with@@ drawing all funding .
so we did n't know what to do , but we decided to cast a very wide net .
we e@@ mailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful .
ka : there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point ?
Dr : no . in fact I told the contractor to go ahead .
he had already ordered materials based on my go@@ -@@ ahead .
we knew that one way or another this was going to happen .
and we just felt it had to happen .
ka : you were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation .
Richard , I think very correctly , made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers im@@ posing aes@@ thetic solutions on this kind of universal , ban@@ al , common problem of sitting .
it seems to me with this , that it was the opposite of that .
this was an unprecedented , singular design problem .
Dr : well here 's the issue : we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site , and think about the need for a memorial .
it was important that this not be categori@@ zed as a memorial .
that this was a place for people to reflect , to remember -- a kind of quiet place .
so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the vie@@ wer -- as we said about the families ' platform -- and the experience as possible .
it 's all incredibly humble material .
it 's sca@@ f@@ folding and pl@@ ywood .
and it allows -- by sort of the proce@@ ssion of the movement , up by Saint Paul 's and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view .
but the design was driven by a need to be quick , cheap , safe , respectful , flexible .
one of the other things is this is designed to be mo@@ v@@ eable .
because when we looked at the four plat@@ forms around the site , one of which is an upgrade of the families ' platform , we knew that these had to be mo@@ v@@ eable to respond to changing conditions , and the changing definition of what G@@ round Zero is .
ka : your work -- I mean , we 've talked about this before -- a lot of your work , I think , is informed by your belief in , or your focus on the tempor@@ ar@@ iness of all things and the E@@ van@@ esc@@ ence of things , and a kind of `` Eat , drink , and be merry , for tomorrow we die , '' sort of sense of existence .
this is clearly not a work for the ages .
you know , a couple of years this thing is n't going to be here .
did that require , as an architect , a new way of thinking about what you were doing ?
to think of it as this purely temporary installation ?
Dr : no , I do n't think so .
I think this is , obviously , substanti@@ ally different from anything we 'd ever thought about doing before , just by the nature of it .
where it over@@ laps with thoughts about our work in general is , number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done .
and Kevin Ken@@ non , Rick Sco@@ fi@@ dio , Liz Di@@ ller and all the people within the city -- Norman L@@ ear , who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding , offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it .
so the notion of collaboration -- I think this reinfor@@ ces how important that is .
and in terms of the temporary nature of it , our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be .
I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city , about what 's really happening there .
and a day or two before it opened was Giu@@ li@@ ani 's farewell address , where he proposed the idea of all of G@@ round Zero being a memorial .
which was very controversial , but it reson@@ ated with a lot of people .
and I think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used , having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter , I think makes it a more powerful dialogue .
and that 's what we were interested in .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things I 've been interested in before .
ka : it seems to me , among other things , a lovely piece of civic infrastructure .
it en@@ ables that conversation to get serious .
and six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly , now , getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious .
do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or should n't be done ?
Dr : well , I think one thing that should n't be done is evaluate -- I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan .
the Prote@@ tch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings , which had some sort of inven@@ tive ideas of buildings .
ka : but it had some really terrible ideas .
Dr : and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas , where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses .
and I think there should be a bro@@ a@@ der -- which there 's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to , what does this site really want to be ?
and I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out , that it 's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
there 's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive , about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over , so that there 's one un@@ interrupted piece of land .
ka : well , I think that 's interesting .
and it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago , but perhaps is n't now , which is , not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture , as what it had done to this city and that huge pla@@ za .
is this an opportunity , is the silver lining -- a silver lining , here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid , or not ?
Dr : I think there 's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities .
and why do we live in places where such dissi@@ mi@@ lar people colli@@ de up against us each day ?
I do n't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces , regardless of what the number is .
so yeah , I think there is a chance to re@@ -@@ look at how we think about cities .
and in fact , there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven .
ka : which was the building just north of the Towers ?
Dr : right , which the towers fell into .
and the reason that 's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they 're not re@@ -@@ opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city .
I think a public dialogue -- I think , you know , I 'd like to see an international competition , and a call for ideas for uses .
ka : whether it 's arts , whether it 's housing , whether it 's what amount of shopping ?
Dr : right . and we 're looking for other things .
this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help .
including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently do n't have a voice in New York to do artist housing .
and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of mono@@ li@@ thic , single solutions , and more about a multi@@ pli@@ city of things .
ka : before we end , I know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform ?
Dr : John Ka@@ men -- who 's here , actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use .
so I thought that would be good to end with .
Dr : we 're looking from Ful@@ ton Street , west .
one of the tricky issues we had with the Giu@@ li@@ ani administration was I had forgotten how anti@@ -@@ graffiti he was .
and essentially our structure was designed to be written on .
ka : as you say , it 's not a memorial .
but were you conscious of memor@@ i@@ als ? the Vietnam Memorial ?
those kinds of forms ?
Dr : we certainly did as much research as we could , and we were conscious of other memor@@ i@@ als .
and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do .
it 's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c , spontaneous solution that expanded on Union Square and the places that were ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c memor@@ i@@ als in the city already .
the sca@@ f@@ folding you can see built up over the street is de@@ -@@ moun@@ table .
what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed , so that what you 're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in G@@ round Zero , but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it , which are enormous .
this shows Saint Paul 's on the left .
ka : I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yor@@ kers for making this happen and getting this done .
but the kind of virtually inst@@ an@@ taneous nature of its erection , and its being there , almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished , is part of its extraordinary -- I do n't know if beauty is the word -- but presence .
Dr : it was an honor to do .
and we were thrilled to be able to show it here .
